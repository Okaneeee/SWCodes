This repo was made with Python ``3.11.9``. So you'll need to install python. You can check the working versions of Python for this repo [here](#dependencies). <br>

The repo uses some dependencies. You can install them by running the following command:

Windows:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Linux:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br>

### Quick Start
You'll need to setup a `.env` file first. The `.env` need to be on the same folder as the repo. You can use the following template, or you can rename the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file to `.env`.

```env
TOKEN =
OWNERID = 
```

**TOKEN** is the bot token you get from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). <br>
*More information [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#configuring-your-bot).* <br>

**OWNERID** is the ID of the owner (you). You can get your ID by right-clicking your name in Discord and selecting `Copy ID`. <br>
*More information on how to get your ID [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498).*
<br>

After, you'll need to [add your bot to your server](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#installing-your-app). <br>
Finally, you can run the bot by running the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

> **ONLY THE OWNER CAN USE THIS COMMAND**.

## Long-Term Support (LTS)

### As the developer 
I will be maintaining this repo for a long time. I will be fixing eventual bugs and do the necessary changes in case of a new Discord API update, a new Python version or if the Summoners War API changes. <br>
I will also be updating the dependencies with [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot). <br>
